# AWS learning materials: 
This repository contains content explaining AWS services and tools, while also explaining the basics of Cloud computing! It is organised in a Daywise manner and provides a ground up approach to learn about AWS. It is Ideal if you want to study for AWS
certification Examinations such as AWS cloud practitioner(CLF-C02) or for AWS certified soltuion Architect(SAA-C03) exams. These are my own personal notes created while working through the wonderful AWS course by Stephan Maarek.
