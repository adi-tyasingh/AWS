# AWS App Runner  

## **What is AWS App Runner?**  
AWS App Runner is a **fully managed service** designed to **deploy and scale web applications and APIs** quickly without worrying about infrastructure management. It allows developers to **deploy containerized applications directly from source code or container images** with minimal configuration.  

‚úÖ **No server management** ‚Äì AWS provisions and manages infrastructure.  
‚úÖ **Automatic scaling** ‚Äì Scales up or down based on traffic demand.  
‚úÖ **Built-in load balancing** ‚Äì Ensures high availability.  
‚úÖ **Supports containers and source code** ‚Äì Deploy directly from GitHub or AWS ECR.  
‚úÖ **Integrated CI/CD** ‚Äì Automatically redeploys applications when code changes.

## **How AWS App Runner Works**  
AWS App Runner simplifies **web application deployment** in just a few steps:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **You provide your application source code or container image** (GitHub repo or AWS Elastic Container Registry).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **App Runner builds and deploys your application** using an **automated build pipeline**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **App Runner provisions compute resources** and sets up a **secure HTTPS endpoint**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **App Runner automatically scales your application** based on incoming traffic.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Built-in monitoring and logging** provide insights into application performance.  

üîπ **Example Use Case:**  
A developer wants to deploy a **Python Flask API** from GitHub **without managing EC2 instances, Kubernetes, or Load Balancers**. AWS App Runner allows them to **deploy the API in minutes with automatic scaling and HTTPS support**.

## **AWS App Runner Features**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Fully Managed Service**  
- No need to **provision, configure, or manage servers**.  
- AWS handles **deployment, scaling, and updates** automatically.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Supports Code & Container Deployments**  
- **Directly from source code (GitHub, Bitbucket).**  
- **From container images (ECR, DockerHub).**  

üîπ **Example: Deploying a Flask App from GitHub**  
- Push code to GitHub.  
- Connect App Runner to GitHub.  
- App Runner builds, deploys, and hosts the app.  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Scaling & Load Balancing**  
- **Auto-scales** based on concurrent request load.  
- **Zero-to-hero scaling** (no traffic = scales to zero, saving costs).  
- **Integrated load balancing** ensures efficient request distribution.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Secure Deployment & HTTPS**  
- **Automatically provisions HTTPS** with AWS Certificate Manager.  
- **IAM Role-Based Access Control** for security.  
- **VPC Support** for private networking.  

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Logging & Monitoring**  
- Integrated with **Amazon CloudWatch** for logs and metrics.  
- **Health checks** ensure application reliability.

## **AWS App Runner Workflow**
üöÄ **Step-by-step execution process**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Select a deployment source** (GitHub repo or AWS ECR).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Configure build & runtime settings** (environment variables, port, instance size).  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **App Runner provisions compute resources** and sets up HTTPS.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Your application is deployed & accessible via a public URL**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **App Runner auto-scales** based on incoming traffic.

## **AWS App Runner Compute Options**
AWS App Runner runs applications on **fully managed compute instances** with different configurations:  

| Instance Size | vCPUs | Memory |
|--------------|------|--------|
| **Small** | 1 vCPU | 2 GB RAM |
| **Medium** | 2 vCPUs | 4 GB RAM |
| **Large** | 4 vCPUs | 8 GB RAM |

üí° **Use Case:**  
- **Small instance** for low-traffic APIs.  
- **Medium/Large instance** for high-performance applications.

## **AWS App Runner vs Other AWS Compute Services**
| Feature | **AWS App Runner** | **AWS Lambda** | **AWS Fargate** | **Elastic Beanstalk** |
|---------|----------------|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Deployment Model** | Fully managed PaaS | Serverless functions | Serverless containers | PaaS for full apps |
| **Auto Scaling** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Best For** | Web apps, APIs | Event-driven workloads | Microservices, containers | Full-stack web apps |
| **Pricing** | Pay per vCPU/memory | Pay per execution time | Pay per vCPU/memory | Pay per EC2 usage |

üí° **Use AWS App Runner when you need a simple, managed solution for containerized web apps and APIs!**  

---

## **AWS App Runner Pricing**
üí∞ **AWS App Runner pricing is based on compute usage:**  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Compute Cost** ‚Äì Billed per second based on vCPU & memory usage.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Request Cost** ‚Äì Pay for the number of requests handled by the service.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Idle Cost** ‚Äì Charges apply even when the application is running but idle.  

üîπ **Optimizing Cost:**  
- Use **auto-scaling** to reduce compute costs.  
- Enable **scaling to zero** when no traffic is present.  
- Use **smaller instances** for lightweight apps.

## **How to Deploy an Application with AWS App Runner**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy from Source Code (GitHub)**
```sh
aws apprunner create-service --service-name my-flask-app \
  --source-configuration "CodeRepository={RepositoryUrl=https://github.com/myrepo, Branch=main, CodeBuildSettings={BuildCommand='pip install -r requirements.txt', RunCommand='python app.py'}}"
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy from a Container (AWS ECR)**
```sh
aws apprunner create-service --service-name my-container-app \
  --source-configuration "ImageRepository={ImageIdentifier=public.ecr.aws/myimage, ImageRepositoryType=ECR_PUBLIC}"
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Application Logs**
```sh
aws apprunner describe-service --service-name my-flask-app
```
