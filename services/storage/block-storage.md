# Block Storage in AWS  

## **1️⃣ What is Block Storage?**  
Block storage is a **low-latency, high-performance storage type** where data is divided into **fixed-sized blocks** and stored independently. Each block has a unique identifier and can be retrieved or modified separately. This makes block storage ideal for use cases requiring **high-speed read/write operations**, such as databases, virtual machines, and containerized applications.

### **🔹 Key Characteristics of Block Storage:**  
✔️ **High Performance:** Suitable for IOPS-intensive applications like databases.  
✔️ **Low Latency:** Data is accessed quickly, making it ideal for mission-critical workloads.  
✔️ **Persistence:** Block storage retains data even if the associated compute instance is restarted.  
✔️ **Modularity:** Storage is divided into independent blocks that can be formatted and managed.  
✔️ **Scalability:** Can increase storage capacity dynamically based on demand.

### **🔹 Amazon EBS Volume Types:**  
EBS offers **different volume types** for performance and cost optimization.  

| **Volume Type** | **Best For** | **Performance (IOPS / Throughput)** | **Cost** |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| **gp3 (General Purpose SSD)** | Most workloads, web apps, gaming | Up to 16,000 IOPS, 1,000 MB/s | $$ |
| **io2 (Provisioned IOPS SSD)** | High-performance databases | Up to 256,000 IOPS, 4,000 MB/s | $$$$ |
| **st1 (Throughput Optimized HDD)** | Big data, data warehouses | 500 MB/s, lower IOPS | $$ |
| **sc1 (Cold HDD)** | Archival, infrequent access | 250 MB/s, lowest cost | $ |

### **🛠️ Use Cases for Amazon EBS:**  
✅ **Databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, MongoDB)** – High-performance transactional workloads.  
✅ **Enterprise Applications (SAP, ERP systems)** – Persistent storage for business-critical apps.  
✅ **Machine Learning (ML) & Big Data** – Fast access to large datasets.  
✅ **Virtual Machines (VMs) & Containers** – Persistent storage for EC2 and Kubernetes workloads.

## **4️⃣ Instance Store – Temporary Block Storage for EC2**  
Instance Store provides **temporary block storage** that is **physically attached** to an EC2 instance. It is designed for applications requiring **very low latency and high-speed disk access** but **does not persist data after instance termination**.

### **🔹 Features of Instance Store:**  
✔️ **Ultra-Fast Storage:** Provides **NVMe SSDs** with very low latency.  
✔️ **Ephemeral Storage:** Data is **lost when EC2 stops or terminates** (not recommended for long-term data).  
✔️ **High IOPS & Throughput:** Ideal for applications that require rapid temporary storage.  
✔️ **No Additional Cost:** Included with certain **EC2 instance types (e.g., C6gd, I4i, M6gd, R6gd, etc.)**.  

### **🛠️ Use Cases for Instance Store:**  
✅ **Temporary Caching** – Storing session data, logs, or caching web content.  
✅ **Big Data Processing** – Storing intermediate datasets for ML and analytics.  
✅ **High-Performance Workloads** – AI/ML, gaming, high-frequency trading.
